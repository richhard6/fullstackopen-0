    participant server


    Note right of browser: I believe that the process of entering into the website is the same as the not SPA website because there are not more views or pages than the current one and when it differs is when a note is created 

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa
    activate server
    server-->>browser: HTML document
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa/main.css
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the css file
    deactivate server

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/spa/main.js
    activate server
    server-->>browser: the JavaScript file
    deactivate server

    Note right of browser: The browser executes the JavaScript code that fetches the JSON from the server and adds an event handler to the form listening for the submit event to execute sending the data to the server, adding the note to the notes array and redrawing the notes.

    browser->>server: GET https://studies.cs.helsinki.fi/exampleapp/data.json
    activate server
    server-->>browser: [{ "content": "SPA the best", "date": "2023-8-9" }, ... ]
    deactivate server

 Note right of browser: The browser executes the redraw function and draw all the notes. (this function will be executed everytime a note is created).
